## Bearcat -- a POJOs based application framework
Bearcat is a POJOs based application framework which provides a lightweight container for writing simple, maintainable [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Bearcat provides an infrastructural backbone to manage business objects so that developers can focus on application-level business logic. Bearcat enables you to build applications from "plain old javaScript object"(POJOS) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs.
